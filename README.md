# AT4BR_final_project
## Julia Kwiecinska, 13.06.2024

This is my final project for AT4BR course :)

Inside, you'll find a Shiny app designed for processing FASTA files along with some sample sequences to use. 

This project originated from my bachelor's thesis titled "Comparing Biological Sequences â€“ Alignment-Based and Free-Alignment Methods". In my thesis, I implemented two free-alignment methods in Python using tkinter to create corresponding apps and compared them with Clustal Omega. Rather than rewriting the Python apps into Shiny R, I chose to develop a new application aimed at extracting information from FASTA files. The sample sequences provided are the exact files used in my bachelor's thesis :)
