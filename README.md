# AT4BR_final_project
## Julia Kwiecinska, 13.06.2024

This is my final project for AT4BR course :)

Inside, you'll find a Shiny app designed for processing FASTA files along with some sample sequences to use. 

This project originated from my bachelor's thesis titled "Comparing Biological Sequences â€“ Alignment-Based and Free-Alignment Methods". In my thesis, I implemented two free-alignment methods in Python using tkinter to create corresponding apps and compared them with Clustal Omega. Rather than rewriting the Python apps into Shiny R, I chose to develop a new application aimed at extracting information from FASTA files. The sample sequences provided are the exact files used in my bachelor's thesis :)

When working on my project I used:
- https://yulab-smu.top/treedata-book/chapter4.html
- https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ggtree.html
- https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html
- https://support.bioconductor.org/p/72398/
- https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-ui.html
- https://fontawesome.com/icons/categories
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33620133/change-the-color-of-action-button-in-shiny and lots of other stackoverflow threads...
- asking ChatGPT with prompts about errors encountered during app development, for example: "Error: unused argument (paging = FALSE)" or "data must be 2-dimensional (e.g. data frame or matrix)"
